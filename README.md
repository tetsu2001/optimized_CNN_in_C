## **Project Objective**ü§ñ: 
Through a hypothesis testing framework, I conducted an experiment to show how optimizing deep learning algorithms by not only utiliing low-level parallelism packages, but also by rewriting core computations to best utilize machine architecture, results in monumental performance improvements, quantified by comparing the naive implementation of 2D CNNs and the optimized version. 

### **Overview**
This project explores the implementation and optimization of 2D convolution algorithms. The main objective was to improve the computational efficiency of these algorithms using various optimization techniques, including SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), OpenMP, and Open MPI. 

### **Key Concepts**
- **Convolutions:** Mathematical operations to determine the overlap between two matrices or vectors, widely used in fields such as signal processing and neural networks.
- **Optimization:** Focused on speeding up computations using modern parallel processing techniques.

### **Tools and Technologies**
- **C Programming Language:** Core language used to write the convolution and optimization functions.
- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):** Used to process multiple data points with a single instruction, leveraging AVX vectorization for parallelism within a CPU core.
- **OpenMP:** Applied to parallelize the algorithm across multiple threads to take advantage of multi-core CPUs.
- **Open MPI:** Implemented for distributed parallelism, allowing for the scaling of the algorithm across multiple machines.
- **Makefile:** Used for compilation and managing the build process.
- **Testing Framework:** A custom testing framework was used to ensure the correctness and performance of the convolution operations.

### **Project Structure**
- **Task 1: Naive Convolutions**  
   Basic 2D convolution implementation without optimization. This task helped establish a baseline for performance comparisons.
  
- **Task 2: Optimization Techniques**
  - **SIMD Optimization:** Implemented using AVX intrinsic functions to perform multiple operations simultaneously, significantly reducing execution time.
  - **OpenMP Parallelization:** Parallelized the convolution process across CPU threads, reducing the runtime on multi-core processors.
  
- **Task 3: Distributed Computing with Open MPI**
   Leveraged Open MPI to distribute the convolution tasks across multiple machines, further increasing the scalability of the solution.

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- Achieved substantial speedup across multiple benchmark tests:
  - **SIMD Optimization:** Achieved up to 8x speedup.
  - **OpenMP:** Further speedup through parallel thread execution.
  - **Open MPI:** Distributed computing for multi-node parallelism.
